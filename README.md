# Data-Semantics-Ontology
🏢 Company Ontology – Semantic Web & Knowledge Representation
Module: ECS7028P – Semantic Technologies | MSc Big Data Science

Developed a comprehensive Company Ontology using OWL, SWRL rules, and SPARQL queries to model business entities, their relationships, and key data attributes. The ontology was designed and validated in Protégé with reasoning via Pellet and HermiT.

💡 Project Highlights:
Modelled real-world company structures including Departments, Products, Services, Industries, and Locations

Defined extensive class hierarchies, object & data properties, and applied domain/range restrictions

Implemented SWRL rules for inferred logic (e.g. LargeCompany, ProfitableCompany, SeniorStaff)

Populated ontology using data from DBPedia and cleaned CSV files, transformed into RDF triples with Python scripts

Used SPARQL queries to retrieve complex patterns such as top UK companies by profit per employee

Addressed modelling challenges and validation issues using semantic reasoners

🛠 Tools & Technologies:
OWL, RDF, SWRL, SPARQL

Protégé, Pellet, HermiT

Python (rdflib, SPARQLWrapper, CSV handling)

This project demonstrates practical expertise in ontology engineering, knowledge modelling, and semantic data integration for real-world business applications.
